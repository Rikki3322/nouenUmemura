    "This house used to be filled with laughter, songs, and sake. Grandpa loved sake and singing, while grandma was hardworking and an exceptional cook.",
    "\"We want this house to become a nursing facility for the community in the future,\" they said. This carefully built traditional Japanese house has long been a gathering place for locals. But one day, grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and had to live in a care facility. Grandpa, left behind, often said, \"Please make use of this house filled with grandma's dreams.\"",
    "Encouraged by his words, I decided to turn this house into a guesthouse. I want it to be a place where travelers gather again and smiles overflow. \"Umemura Farmhouse Inn\" holds such family wishes.",
    "May the time spent here become a gentle memory for all visitors."
